# Brew & Beans - Coffee Shop Website

This is a complete, production-ready multi-page website built for a coffee shop using Tailwind CSS (CDN) with a coffee-focused design system.

What you get:
- 3 pages: Home (index.html), About (about.html), Contact (contact.html)
- Coffee-shop themed styling with a warm, accessible color palette
- Font pairing: Montserrat for headings, Open Sans for body text
- Background hero images via placeholder syntax (e.g., https://source.unsplash.com/random/1600x900/?...)
- Fully responsive, semantic HTML5 structure
- Internal navigation between pages
- Lightweight interactive form with basic submission feedback

How to run:
1. Open the three files in a browser:
   - index.html
   - about.html
   - contact.html
2. Optionally host them on a static server or a hosting service.
3. Replace all https://source.unsplash.com/random/1600x900/?... placeholders with actual image assets or keep them as placeholders if you’re using a template engine that renders them.

Design notes:
- Primary color: coffee brown tones
- Accent: latte beige for call-to-action and highlights
- Typography: Montserrat (headings) + Open Sans (body)

Extending the site:
- To add more pages, copy the existing HTML structure and maintain navigation consistency.
- To update styling globally, adjust color values in the Tailwind utility classes or extend Tailwind config if you’re building with a local setup.
